saufi is a german drinking game, you put in your usernames and just do what the app tells you.
you can play this at [https://saufi.giveme.pizza/](https://saufi.giveme.pizza/)

i made this a website so everyone can use it from anywhere.


## my code is shit, i wrote this on one afternoon and im really tired right now. also, i dont really care. it works.


feel free to fix / add anything and open a pr. This website is primarly made for use on phones, so I dont really care if the UI is messed up on PC.


dares are in the [dares.js](dares.js) file. Feel free to add dares so this game does not get boring so fast!


if i dont respond here on github you can message me on discord: treppi (treppi#9999)
